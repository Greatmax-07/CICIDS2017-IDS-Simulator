Since this was also a Data Analytics project for college, we were expected to do part of the analysis using tools like Excel instead of just coding everything in Python. 
So I downloaded the full CIC-IDS-2017 dataset from Kaggle, explored it manually in Excel, and selected the most relevant features based on packet behaviors, traffic stats, etc.
These selected features were then used as input to the "data_cleaning.py" script, which created the "cleaned_dataset" for training.  
The final set of selected columns was:
1. Destination Port
2. Flow Duration
3. Total Fwd Packets
4. Total Backward Packets
5. Total Length of Fwd Packets
6. Total Length of Bwd Packets
7. Fwd Packet Length Max
8. Fwd Packet Length Min
9. Fwd Packet Length Mean
10. Fwd Packet Length Std
11. Bwd Packet Length Max
12. Bwd Packet Length Min
13. Bwd Packet Length Mean
14. Bwd Packet Length Std
15. Flow Bytes/s
16. Flow Packets/s
17. Fwd IAT Mean
18. Fwd IAT Std
19. Bwd IAT Mean
20. Bwd IAT Std
21. Fwd Header Length
22. Bwd Header Length
23. Packet Length Mean
24. Label
